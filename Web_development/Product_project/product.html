    <h2 id="Types">Types</h2>
    There are various types of guitar.
    <ol>
      <li class="gtypes">Classical Guitar</li>
      <p>Classical guitar is used to play classical Spanish music, the other classical music, pop, folk, Latin, and jazz. Nylon strings also help players easily to practice the newer techniques. The artists who play classical guitar need to have fingernails on the right hand longer and depending on which type they will play, they shape the nail as is recommended. Shaping nails and nail length allows players to complete the extremely complex music because Music for Classical Guitar is the most difficult type of all guitar music.</p>
      <li class="gtypes">Acoustic Guitar</li>
      <p>Acoustic guitars are wonderful instruments for folk music, ragtime, blues, pop and many other types of music. This is also a very common type of guitar to play modern church music. Like classical guitar, the vibration of the soundboard generates sound of the acoustic guitar, especially the surfaces.</p>
      <li class="gtypes">Bass Guitar</li>
      <p>The bass guitar is one of the variants of the electric guitar; the fret board is longer and the guitar strings are thicker. Traditional bass guitar has only 4 strings but the modern bass guitar can have 5-6 strings, based on custom design. Like the electric guitar, this is the guitar that has solid body design and the strings generate sound by the amplifier.</p>
      <li class="gtypes">Electric Guitar</li>
      <p>Electric guitar fret board is narrower than the Acoustic Guitar. This makes the electric guitar become the easiest instrument to play in all kinds of guitar, especially easy for people with small hands. The strings are not as tense as Acoustic Guitar’s steel strings but are a little bit tenser than nylon strings.</p>
      <li class="gtypes">Acoustic-Electric Guitar</li>
      <p>Acoustic – Electric is a variant of Acoustic guitar, and it is installed more pickups and amplifiers. This design allows the player to use the guitar in any situations, from a solo practice to a performance on stage.

When being used as an electric guitar, the Electric-Acoustic is like an electric guitar, and the pickup also miss the vibration of the Guitar body. When being used as an Acoustic Guitar, it sounds like any other Acoustic Guitar but not too loud. The body of Acoustic Electric is usually thinner than other Acoustic guitar types.</p>
