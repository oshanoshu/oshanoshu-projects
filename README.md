<strong>4. FTP_Server and FTP_client </strong>
This includes the project files for multithreaded socket programming done in Java. It can successfully implement the file transfer process from Server to multiple-clients and vice-versa. It also keeps the record of the files in separate folder for each client and handles the redundancy in file names. It has features like unique id and password for clients, and new user can set up a new account. Users can upload or download or just see what they have in their account.
